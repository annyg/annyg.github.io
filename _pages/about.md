#### **About me**

Hello! I'm Anders, a researcher and data scientist at [Oslo University Hospital](https://www.ous-research.no/home/dahl/Group+members/22071).

My work revolves around a variety of research projects, with a current focus on COVID-19, clinical trials, and epidemiology. With a background in microbiology and bioinformatics, I bring a unique perspective to my research. My journey has led me through diverse roles, including two years as an indoor climate and construction consultant before my current position.

Beyond my research, I'm passionate about education. I'm a lecturer at [Oslo Metropolitan University](https://www.oslomet.no/en), where I lecture in MSc. courses on indoor climate, sanitation, and health for engineering students at the [Faculty of Technology, Art and Design](https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/tkd). I also host workshops on data science and academic writing for PhD students at the [Faculty of Health Sciences](https://www.oslomet.no/en/about/hv).

Additionally, I've taken on consulting and industry projects, guiding clients through data management and analysis challenges.

For insights into my career path, experiences, and extracurricular activities, explore the "CV" section. You can also find some of my talks and lectures in the "Talks" section.

Feel free to reach out by email if you have questions or potential project ideas.

Thank you for visiting my page!
