### News

I am very excited to share that happy to announce that our study published in [Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59771-0) investigating the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes is one of the most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.

The paper has been added to the [**Top 100 in Microbiology**](https://www.nature.com/collections/hjjcbjfhhc) collection, which showcases the top 100 most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.

This study was part of my PhD project and I am very happy to see it being recognized and downloaded by the scientific community.
