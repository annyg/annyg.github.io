### News

We recently published an op-ed in *Tidsskrift for Norsk psykologforening*: **‚ÄúFeilaktig fremstilling av kunnskapsgrunnlaget for post-covid condition (long covid)‚Äù**. Tidsskrift for Norsk psykologforening (often shortened to Psykologtidsskriftet) is the official journal of the Norwegian Psychological Association. It is a leading professional publication for psychologists in Norway, publishing research articles, clinical reports, debate pieces, and opinion columns.

In the article, we respond to claims that long covid is primarily a psychosomatic condition treatable with so-called Mind-Body Reprogramming Therapy. We emphasize that this portrayal misrepresents the scientific evidence. More than **17,000 studies worldwide** now show that long covid is a **multi-organ, systemic disease** with clear biological underpinnings, including immunological, cellular, and physiological changes across multiple organ systems.

We argue that failing to recognize these findings risks **misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment, and harm to patients**. Long covid must be researched and treated as a distinct post-viral condition, not reduced to a generic category of unexplained fatigue.
