### News

We recently published an op-ed in _Utdanningsnytt_: **‚ÄúVi m√• beskytte l√¶rerne mot long covid‚Äù** (_We must protect teachers from long covid_).

_Utdanningsnytt_ is the official news site and magazine of the **Union of Education Norway (Utdanningsforbundet)**, which is the country‚Äôs largest trade union for teachers and other education professionals.

In this piece, we argue that preventing long covid requires more than treatment ‚Äî it requires reducing infections in schools and workplaces. Since COVID-19 is airborne, we highlight how improved **indoor air quality** can make a real difference. Ventilation, air filtration, and modern UVC technology are all proven tools that can reduce the spread of viruses indoors.

Teachers and school staff are particularly at risk, with over a third of covid-related occupational injury reports coming from this group. Protecting them means making schools safe workplaces through better air quality.

We call for a national effort to improve indoor environments in schools and kindergartens ‚Äî both to prevent long covid today and to strengthen Norway‚Äôs preparedness for future pandemics.
