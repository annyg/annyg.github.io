### News

I am excited to share our study investigating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections on executive functioning in a large cohort of 8000 participants. The study is published in [Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.uio.no/science/article/pii/S2666354624001352).

This study is a part of a [PhD project](https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.uio.no/science/article/pii/S1551714422002816), where we examine the effect of cognitive rehabilitation for long-COVID.

#### Abstract

**Importance**: Despite the major implications of executive deficits in day-to-day functioning, few studies have investigated this in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection using standardized measures that differentiate between aspects of executive function.

**Objective**: Examine whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with deficits in executive functions and if so, investigate the duration of this association.

**Design, Setting, and Participants**: The present research has a cross-sectional design and uses data from the Norwegian Covid-19 Cohort study. The current cohort (n = 8102) completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function- Adult Version (BRIEF-A) electronically between April 2021 and September 2021. During the assessment, 4183 of the included participants had a prior positive polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 and 3919 were untested or had a confirmed negative PCR test.

**Exposure**: Laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**Main outcomes and measures**: Executive functions were measured using the BRIEF-A, a self-report questionnaire comprising 75 items within nine theoretically and empirically distinct clinical scales. All participants self-reported on demographical variables and comorbidity. Information on sex and age was derived from the personal identification number, and vaccination status was obtained from the Norwegian Immunization Registry (SYSVAK).

**Results**: Participants with a positive SARS-CoV-2 status reported executive deficits in everyday life above the clinical threshold (T-score ≥65) more often than non-infected controls (383 vs. 225). Specifically, the SARS-CoV-2 positive status group indicated significantly more deficits related to metacognition, with the greatest difference demonstrated for working memory. This difference remained when adjusting for various demographic factors and comorbidities, with significantly greater odds of reporting above the clinical threshold following SARS-CoV-2 infection, as observed on the global executive composite score 6–12 months after infection (OR 1.97; 95% CI 1.51 to 2.55).

**Conclusions**: Our study confirms more perceived executive deficits following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to non-infected controls, with metacognitive aspects being the most affected. These findings shed light on the potential functional difficulties that individuals may encounter during the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and may guide further development of targeted interventions addressing metacognitive domains of executive functioning.
