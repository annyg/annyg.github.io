### News

I am thrilled to announce the publication of our latest research paper in our large Norwegian COVID-19 Cohort Study with more than 160 000 study participants. This extensive study has allowed us to delve deeper into the long-term effects of COVID-19, a topic that is still largely undefined due to a lack of large-scale studies.

Our research focused on the persistent symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients, even up to 22 months after their initial SARS-CoV-2 test. We found that memory and concentration problems were reported more frequently by those who tested positive, even when accounting for symptoms present before the onset of COVID-19. Other persistent symptoms included fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia, and dysgeusia.

These findings underscore the long-term cognitive and somatic impacts of COVID-19, and the importance of ongoing support and care for those affected. We hope that our research will contribute to a better understanding of the long-term effects of COVID-19 and help inform future healthcare strategies.

The paper is published in [International Journal of Infectious Diseases](<https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(24)00334-5/fulltext>).

#### Abstract

**Background**
There is a lack of large studies on long-COVID symptoms with symptoms measurements before the onset of COVID-19. Therefore, long-COVID is still poorly defined.

**Methods**
The Norwegian COVID-19 Cohort Study is a population-based, open cohort of adult participants (aged 18-96 years) from Norway. From March 27, 2020, participants were recruited through social media, invitations, and nationwide media coverage. Fourteen somatic and cognitive symptoms were assessed at baseline and four follow-ups for up to 22 months. SARS-CoV-2 test status was obtained from a mandatory national registry or from self-report.

**Findings**
After follow-up, 15 737 participants had a SARS-CoV-2-positive test, 67 305 a negative test, and 37 563 were still untested. Persistent symptoms reported more frequently by positive compared with negative participants one month after infection, were memory problems (3-6 months: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.8, CI = 5.7-8.1; >18 months: aOR = 9.4, CI = 4.1-22), and concentration problems (3-6 months: aOR = 4.1, CI = 3.5-4.7; >18 months: aOR = 4.4, CI = 2.0-9.7) as well fatigue, dyspnoea, anosmia and dysgeusia.

**Interpretation**
COVID-19 was associated with cognitive symptoms, anosmia, dysgeusia, dyspnoea and fatigue as well as worsening of overall health up to 22 months after a SARS-CoV-2 test, even when correcting for symptoms before the onset of COVID-19.
