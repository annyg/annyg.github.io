### News

Our research on **excess all-cause mortality in Norway** has been featured in a new article from NRK: [_Koronaforskere: Advarer om hÃ¸ye dÃ¸dstall_](https://www.nrk.no/buskerud/koronaforskere_-advarer-om-hoye-dodstall-1.17551278) .

The NRK story highlights our findings that Norway recorded **11,588 more deaths than expected between 2022 and 2024** compared to pre-pandemic trends â€” a number greater than Norwegian civilian losses during World War II. Particularly concerning is the excess mortality seen in younger age groups, including children, young adults, and those under 65.

In the article, we emphasize that this represents an ongoing **public health crisis**, and we point to SARS-CoV-2 and its long-term consequences as a likely driver. While the Norwegian Institute of Public Health disputes this interpretation, we believe the persistence of excess mortality signals a new elevated mortality baseline that must be taken seriously.
