Other acute respiratory infections were indicated by the third and fourth co-primary endpoints: a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and self-reported symptoms. Side effects related to the supplementation were self-reported. The fallback method was used to handle multiple comparisons.</p> <p>Results: Supplementation with cod liver oil was not associated with a reduced risk of any of the co-primary endpoints. Participants took the supplement (cod liver oil or placebo) for a median of 164 days, and 227 (1.31%) participants in the cod liver oil group and 228 (1.32%) participants in the placebo group had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (relative risk 1.00, multiple comparison adjusted confidence interval 0.82 to 1.22). Serious covid-19 was identified in 121 (0.70%) participants in the cod liver oil group and in 101 (0.58%) participants in the placebo group (1.20, 0.87 to 1.65). 8546 (49.46%) and 8565 (49.44%) participants in the cod liver oil and placebo groups, respectively, had ≥1 negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (1.00, 0.97 to 1.04). 3964 (22.94%) and 3834 (22.13%) participants in the cod liver oil and placebo groups, respectively, reported ≥1 acute respiratory infections (1.04, 0.97 to 1.11). Only low grade side effects were reported in the cod liver oil and placebo groups.</p> <p>Conclusion: Supplementation with cod liver oil in the winter did not reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections compared with placebo.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news_publication"/><category term="publication"/><category term="bmj"/><category term="ncc"/><category term="cloc"/><category term="covid19"/><category term="vitaminD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cod liver oil for prevention of COVID-19 (CLOC-study) published in The BMJ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">News – Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection</title><link href="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="News – Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection"/><published>2021-03-31T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-31T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="news">News</h3> <p>I am very ecited to share that happy to announce that our study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59771-0">Scientific Reports</a> investigating the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes is one of the most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.</p> <p>The paper has been added to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/hjjcbjfhhc"><strong>Top 100 in Microbiology</strong></a> collection, which showcases the top 100 most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.</p> <p>This study was part of my PhD project and I am very happy to see it being recognized and downloaded by the scientific community. publication_preview/</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news_publication"/><category term="publication"/><category term="scirep"/><category term="phd"/><category term="microbiome"/><category term="award"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection for 2020]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">News – Publication in Scientific Reports</title><link href="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="News – Publication in Scientific Reports"/><published>2020-03-01T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="news">News</h3> <p>I am happy to announce that our study investigating the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes has been published.</p> <p>The study is published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59771-0">Scientific Reports</a>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure from the paper showing the correlation of identified taxa at different taxonomic levels. </div> <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>There is a growing awareness of the importance of indoor microbiomes for human health. Given their complexity, these microbiomes can only be adequately surveyed using high throughput sequencing techniques. Oxford Nanopore’s MinION is the newest third generation sequencing technology on the market. With its many advantages such as portability, user friendliness, simplicity, speed of sequencing and long read length, the technology is now an actual contender to established sequencing platforms. MinION’s main disadvantage is a relatively low read accuracy compared to several other platforms, although this is constantly improving. The present study, which appears to be the first of its kind, provides the results of a preliminary analysis of the microbial communities in indoor environments based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, using both the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinIOn and the Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencers. At the level of family and above, there was no significant difference between the microbial compositions as revealed by the two platforms. However, at the genus, and particularly at the species level, the ONT MinION reported greater taxonomic resolution than Illumina MiSeq.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news_publication"/><category term="publication"/><category term="scirep"/><category term="phd"/><category term="microbiome"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[16S sequencing using Nanopore and Illumina published in Scientific Reports]]></summary></entry></feed>
