It was a four-day event that brought together researchers, clinicians, and students from around the world to share their latest findings and insights on various topics related to neuropsychology.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/welcome-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/welcome-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/welcome-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/welcome.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/times_square2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/times_square2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/times_square2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/times_square2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/brooklyn-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/brooklyn-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/brooklyn-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/brooklyn.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The conference program was packed with interesting and informative sessions, ranging from keynote lectures and symposia to poster presentations and workshops. The topics covered a wide range of areas, including the neuropsychology of aging, neurodevelopmental disorders, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases. There were also several sessions focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the brain and cognition.</p> <p>As a member of the <a href="https://the-ins.org/sigs/">NeuroCOVID-19 special interest group</a>, I was also particularly interested in topics related to COVID-19 and its impact on the brain and cognition. The special interest group had a designated workshop session where we discussed the the current state of COVID-19 research, and discussed the future of neuropsychological sequelae of COVID-19, the challenges of assessing and treating patients with long COVID, and the potential mechanisms of neuroinvasion and neuroinflammation caused by the virus. We also had the chance to present a poster on the topic of executive dysfunction after COVID-19, which received positive feedback and sparked interesting discussions with other attendees.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/poster_session-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/poster_session-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/poster_session-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/poster_session.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/poster-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/poster-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/poster-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/poster.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/paper_session-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/paper_session-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/paper_session-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/paper_session.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>I also enjoyed networking with other attendees and exchanging ideas and experiences. I met some of the leading experts in the field, as well as some of the emerging talents. I learned a lot from their feedback and suggestions, and I hope to collaborate with some of them in the future.</p> <p>In addition to attending the conference, I also had a great time visiting New York and Manhattan. The conference center was conveniently situated in the middle of Times Square, and in the off time I got to explore the city in the February weather and visit several of the iconic landmarks. I also had the chance to try some delicious bucket-list foods.</p> <p>Overall, the INS NYC 2024 conference was a rewarding and stimulating experience for me. I gained new knowledge, expanded my professional network, and had fun exploring the city. I would highly recommend future INS meetings for those who find topics related to neuropsychology and cognition interesting.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog"/><category term="conference"/><category term="conference"/><category term="travel"/><category term="covid19"/><category term="ncc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Experiences at the INS NYC 2024 Conference]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">News – Publication in The BMJ</title><link href="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2022/publication_bmj_cloc/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="News – Publication in The BMJ"/><published>2022-09-07T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-09-07T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://annyg.github.io/blog/2022/publication_bmj_cloc</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2022/publication_bmj_cloc/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="news">News</h3> <p>I am happy to announce that our study investigating whether D-vitamin and cod liver oil supplementation can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections in adults in Norway has been published.</p> <p>The study is published in <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/378/bmj-2022-071245.long">The BMJ</a>.</p> <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>Objective: To determine if daily supplementation with cod liver oil, a low dose vitamin D supplement, in winter, prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections in adults in Norway.</p> <p>Design: Quadruple blinded, randomised placebo controlled trial.</p> <p>Setting: Norway, 10 November 2020 to 2 June 2021.</p> <p>Participants: 34 601 adults (aged 18-75 years), not taking daily vitamin D supplements.</p> <p>Intervention: 5 mL/day of cod liver oil (10 µg of vitamin D, n=17 278) or placebo (n=17 323) for up to six months.</p> <p>Main outcome measures: Four co-primary endpoints were predefined: the first was a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result determined by reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the second was serious covid-19, defined as self-reported dyspnoea, admission to hospital, or death. Other acute respiratory infections were indicated by the third and fourth co-primary endpoints: a negative SARS-CoV-2 test result and self-reported symptoms. Side effects related to the supplementation were self-reported. The fallback method was used to handle multiple comparisons.</p> <p>Results: Supplementation with cod liver oil was not associated with a reduced risk of any of the co-primary endpoints. Participants took the supplement (cod liver oil or placebo) for a median of 164 days, and 227 (1.31%) participants in the cod liver oil group and 228 (1.32%) participants in the placebo group had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (relative risk 1.00, multiple comparison adjusted confidence interval 0.82 to 1.22). Serious covid-19 was identified in 121 (0.70%) participants in the cod liver oil group and in 101 (0.58%) participants in the placebo group (1.20, 0.87 to 1.65). 8546 (49.46%) and 8565 (49.44%) participants in the cod liver oil and placebo groups, respectively, had ≥1 negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (1.00, 0.97 to 1.04). 3964 (22.94%) and 3834 (22.13%) participants in the cod liver oil and placebo groups, respectively, reported ≥1 acute respiratory infections (1.04, 0.97 to 1.11). Only low grade side effects were reported in the cod liver oil and placebo groups.</p> <p>Conclusion: Supplementation with cod liver oil in the winter did not reduce the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, serious covid-19, or other acute respiratory infections compared with placebo.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news"/><category term="publication"/><category term="publication"/><category term="bmj"/><category term="ncc"/><category term="cloc"/><category term="covid19"/><category term="vitaminD"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cod liver oil for prevention of COVID-19 (CLOC-study) published in The BMJ]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection</title><link href="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection"/><published>2021-03-31T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-31T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2021/scirep_nano_top100/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="news">News</h3> <p>I am very excited to share that happy to announce that our study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59771-0">Scientific Reports</a> investigating the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes is one of the most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.</p> <p>The paper has been added to the <a href="https://www.nature.com/collections/hjjcbjfhhc"><strong>Top 100 in Microbiology</strong></a> collection, which showcases the top 100 most downloaded microbiology papers published in Scientific Reports in 2020.</p> <p>This study was part of my PhD project and I am very happy to see it being recognized and downloaded by the scientific community.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="news"/><category term="publication"/><category term="publication"/><category term="scirep"/><category term="phd"/><category term="microbiome"/><category term="award"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Scientific Reports paper in Top 100 collection for 2020]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">News – Publication in Scientific Reports</title><link href="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="News – Publication in Scientific Reports"/><published>2020-03-01T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-03-01T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://annyg.github.io/blog/2020/publication_scirep_nano/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="news">News</h3> <p>I am happy to announce that our study investigating the potential of Nanopore MinION and Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize building-dust microbiomes has been published.</p> <p>The study is published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59771-0">Scientific Reports</a>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/publication_preview/scirep_nano.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure from the paper showing the correlation of identified taxa at different taxonomic levels. </div> <h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4> <p>There is a growing awareness of the importance of indoor microbiomes for human health.
